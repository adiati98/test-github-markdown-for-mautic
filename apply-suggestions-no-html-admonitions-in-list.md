## Communication expectation

1. Always leave a detailed description in the pull request (PR). Leave nothing ambiguous for the reviewers.
2. Provide screenshots for visual changes.
3. Always review your code first. Be sure to run the project locally and test it thoroughly before requesting a review.
4. Communicate in the GitHub repository first before Slack. Whether it's in the issue or the PR, keeping the lines of communication open and visible to everyone on the team helps everyone around you.

## Issues

- When you contribute to the project for the first time, please consider checking the [good first issue](https://github.com/mautic/developer-documentation-new/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/mautic/developer-documentation-new/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) labels.

- If you wish to work on an open issue, please comment on the issue, and a maintainer will assign it to you.

  If an issue isn't assigned, it's assumed to be available for anyone to work on. So, ensure that you're assigned to an issue **before** beginning work to avoid conflicts.

<!-- CHANGE TO ADMONITION. -->

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Please don't ask maintainers to assign you to another issue before you have finished working on yours and created a PR.

- Please don't ask maintainers to assign you to an issue that already has someone assigned to it. If the assigned issue hasn't been addressed for a while and you're interested in working on it, leave a comment to ask about its status and progress.

- Did you spot a typo, missing instructions, or have an idea for enhancing the Mautic Developer Documentation? You can [create an issue](https://github.com/mautic/developer-documentation-new/issues/new/choose) to address it.

  However, the Education Team needs to triage the issue before you can work on it. If you wish to work on the issue you submitted, please inform and tag the `@mautic/education-team-leaders` in the comment.

## Pull requests (PRs)

PRs are always welcome. However, before working on changes, you must ensure that **you are assigned** to an existing issue and **link your work to the issue in your PR**.

### Before submitting a PR

1. Ensure that you work on your changes in a new branch on your fork. Create one branch for each task you work on.
2. Run and check your changes locally. Ensure that everything functions as intended.

### Submitting a PR

1. Ensure that you address one issue in one PR. If you work on multiple issues, work on them separately and create one PR to address each issue.
2. Make sure you give clear information about your changes in your PR:

   - **A title**. The PR title must describe the changes you made. For example: `Add getting started page to API documentation`.
   - **A description**. A clear description can help PR reviewers understand the changes you made in your PR. It's always good to walk through the process of how a reviewer can test your changes.
   - **A related issue**. [Link the issue number](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) that you worked on and add a keyword of 'Closes', 'Fixes', or 'Resolves' in front of it. For example, `Closes #123`, `Fixes #234`, etc. You can find the issue number right next to the issue's title. Linking the issue number automatically closes it once your PR is merged.

3. Provide screenshots for visual changes if necessary.

> [!TIP]
>
> Refer to [PR #369](https://github.com/mautic/mautic-community-handbook/pull/369) in the Mautic Community Handbook for an example of a well-documented PR.

### After submitting a PR

1. Ensure that all checks pass. If the linting build or prose fails, debug and fix it until all pass. If you have questions or need help, feel free to tag the `@mautic/education-team-leaders` in the comment.
2. Please don't DM maintainers on Slack to review or ask feedback and questions about your PR.

   If you'd like feedback or ask questions about your PR, tag `@mautic/education-team-leaders` in the comment of your PR or use the `#t-education` channel on Slack. That way, not only maintainers, but the community can help you get unstuck. The team always receives a notification whenever an incoming PR is submitted. If you haven't received a review within a week, you can tag them in the PR comments to ask for an estimated review time.

3. Keep your branch up to date while waiting for review.
4. Respond and address the reviewer's feedback. Please don't request a review until you've addressed all feedback.

## Contributing workflow

In this section, you can find the contributing workflow and best practices for contributing to this project.

### Forking the repository

Forking this repository is the first step you need to take before proceeding. Forking means making a copy of a repository to your GitHub account.

To fork this repository:

1. In the main page of [mautic/developer-documentation-new](https://github.com/mautic/developer-documentation-new), click the 'Fork' button at the top.

   ![Fork button on GitHub](../assets/images/fork_button_github.png)

2. Choose your username in the 'Owner *' dropdown menu. **Don't select an organization here. Always choose your personal account**; otherwise, maintainers can't collaborate or fix issues in your PR.

   ![Choose fork owner on GitHub](../assets/images/choose_fork_owner_github.png)

3. Uncheck the option of 'Copy the DEFAULT-BRANCH-NAME branch only' because later on, you want to be able to clone multiple branches.

4. Click the green 'Create fork' button at the bottom.

   ![An uncheck state option to copy only default branch and a create fork button on GitHub](../assets/images/uncheck_option_and_create_fork_button_github.png)

### Clone the repository

After you forked the repository, you need to clone it. Cloning means copying a repository to your local environment. In this case, you want to clone your forked repository.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Mautic Developer Documentation contains multiple branches that represent specific versions of Mautic. You should clone each branch into its own dedicated folder and make your changes within the appropriate folder.
>
> So, for example, when you need to make documentation changes for Mautic version 5, clone the branch `5.x` and save it in a folder. You can name the folder anything you want, but it's best to reflect the branch name. For example, use a name like `dev-docs-5`.

Follow the steps below to clone your forked repository:

1. Click your avatar on the top right.
2. Click 'Repositories'.

   ![Repositories option from a dropdown menu on GitHub](../assets/images/repositories_option_github.png)

3. Open your forked user-documentation repository. The URL should have your username. For example: `https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/developer-documentation-new`.
4. Click the green 'Code' button on top.
5. Select 'HTTPS' and copy the URL.

   ![Highlight of code button, copy symbol, and HTTPS tab on GitHub](../assets/images/code_button_https_tab_github.png)

6. In your terminal, go to your local directory where you want to save this project.
7. Run the `git clone` command specifying the branch and folder name, and hit Enter:

   ```bash
   git clone --branch BRANCH-NAME https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/developer-documentation-new FOLDER-NAME
   ```

   Here's an example:

   ```bash
   git clone --branch 5.x https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/developer-documentation-new dev-docs-5
   ```

### Create a new branch

Before making changes, ensure that you create a new branch and work on it. You don't want to directly work on the default — such as `main` — or any other base branch, because you won't be able to work on lots of things at the same time. If you make all those changes on one branch, you can't separate them and merge only one change at a time.

#### Ensure the correct base branch

Before you create a new branch, you must ensure that you're on the branch that you need to base your changes on. Here's how to do it:

1. In the bottom left of your VS Code, look at the branch tab — it has a git branch symbol with a branch name. It should indicate the branch you need to base your changes on.

   ![Branch tab at the bottom left of VS Code](../assets/images/bottom_branch_tab_vscode.png)
   
2. If you're not on the correct branch, click the branch tab and select the correct branch from the dropdown menu at the top.

   If you prefer to switch it from the terminal, run the command below:

   ```bash
   git switch BRANCH-NAME
   ```

#### Ways to create a new branch

There are two ways to create a new branch:

1. **With Git Source Control in VS Code**

   Working with [Git source control](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview?originUrl=%2Fdocs%2Fsourcecontrol%2Fintro-to-git) in VS Code is more comfortable if you're not technical and prefer a Graphical User Interface (GUI) over a terminal.

   To create a new branch with Git source control:

   1. Click the branch tab — it has a git branch symbol with a branch name — at the bottom left of your VS Code. It opens a dropdown menu at the top.

   2. Click 'Create new branch...'

      ![Create a new branch option in a dropdown menu on VS Code](../assets/images/create_a_new_branch_vscode.png)

   3. Type the branch name with anything you like. Preferably, it reflects your changes, for example, `fix-typo`.

   4. Hit enter.

2. **On terminal**

   If you prefer working with the terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-NAME
   ```

### Push changes to the remote repository

If you have finished with your changes, you can push them to the remote repository to create a PR. Push means moving your commits from your local to the remote repository.

There are two ways to push your changes to the remote repository:

1. **With Git Source Control in VS Code**

   1. On the left panel, click the 'Source Control' — resembles the git branches icon.

      ![Source control icon on VS Code](../assets/images/git_source_control_vscode.png)

   2. Click the '+' icon next to the name of the file to move it to the 'stage' phase. It means you're adding this file as 'ready' to commit.

   3. After you add all the files that you want to commit, add a commit message describing the changes you made. For example, `fix broken links`.

   4. Click the 'Commit' button.

      ![Highlight plus icon to stage files, commit message input, and commit button at Source Control at VS Code](../assets/images/stage_and_commit_source_control_vscode.png)

   5. Click the 'Publish Branch', which opens a dropdown menu.

      ![Publish branch button on source control at VS Code](../assets/images/publish_branch_button_github.png)

   6. Select `origin: <YOUR-FORKED-REPOSITORY-URL>`.

      ![Highlight origin remote repository in a dropdown menu on Source Control at VS Code](../assets/images/select_remote_repo_dropdown_menu_source_control_vscode.png)

2. **On terminal**

   1. Run `git status`. It provides you with file paths of the files you've worked on. You can later copy these paths for the next step.
   2. Add the file path(s) that hold your changes to the 'stage' phase by running this command:

      ```bash
      git add file-path-1 file-path-2
      ```

   3. Commit your changes with this command:

      ```bash
      git commit -m "your message"
      ```

      Change `your message` to briefly describe your changes. For example, `fix broken links`.

   4. Push your changes to the remote repository:

      ```bash
      git push -u origin YOUR-BRANCH-NAME
      ```

### Create a PR

Once you've pushed your changes, you are ready to create a PR. To do so:

1. Go to [https://github.com/mautic/developer-documentation-new](https://github.com/mautic/developer-documentation-new) and click the green button that prompts you to create a PR.

2. **This step is crucial.** Each branch contains documentation for a specific version of Mautic. You must base your PR on the branch that corresponds to the version you are modifying. If you don't, your changes may apply to the wrong version of the documentation. For instance, if you're making updates for the documentation version `5.x`, you must base your PR on the `5.x` branch.

    At the top, you should see several dropdown menus: 'base repository', 'base', 'head repository', and 'compare'.

    Click the 'base: BRANCH-NAME'. It should open a dropdown menu. Select the base branch to the branch that your PR modifies.

    ![Highlight of PR base branch on GitHub](../assets/images/change_pr_base_branch_github.png)

3. Fill in the PR template. Please read the "[Submitting a PR](#submitting-a-pr)" section for all the information you need to include in your PR for the reviewers.

4. Submit it for review.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you mistakenly based your PR on the wrong branch or selected the wrong branch when creating a PR, as in step 2, follow the steps in the next "[Git cherry-pick](#git-cherry-pick)" section.

#### Git cherry-pick

Say you need to update the documentation for version `7.0`. By mistake, you create a new branch from branch `5.x` and work on this branch. Or you correctly apply your changes based on branch `7.0`, but when you create the PR, you forgot to set the base branch to `7.0`.

If this happens, the Education Team requests that you rebase your PR. You can either [rebase your PR](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase) or create a new PR and use [git cherry-pick](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/cherry-pick) to incorporate your commits as follows:

1. In your code editor, [create a new branch](#create-a-new-branch) and make sure that you base your new branch on the branch that you need to work on.
2. On GitHub, go to your PR and close your PR by clicking the 'Close pull request' button at the bottom.

   ![Close pull request button on GitHub](../assets/images/close_pr_button_github.png)

3. Click the 'Commits' tab at the top. You should see the list of your commits.

   ![Commits tab and list of commits on GitHub](../assets/images/commits_tab_github.png)

4. Click the copy icon next to the hash to copy the full SHA value. If you have multiple commits, start at the top and work through to the end.

   ![Copy icon button to copy the full SHA value on GitHub](../assets/images/copy_full_sha_github.png)

5. In your terminal, run this command:

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick commit-hash          
   ```

   Change the `commit-hash` with the full SHA value that you've copied. Here's an example:

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick a1b2c3d4e5f678901234567890abcdef12345678
   ```

6. If there are merge conflicts, resolve them before continuing. Once you've resolved them, you need to add the file(s) to the stage phase and continue the process:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git cherry-pick --continue
   ```

   If you're using VS Code and a new tab opens to change the commit message, you can either enter a new one or close the tab to keep the original.

   You might get prompted with the following message:

   ```bash
   On branch BRANCH-NAME
   You are currently cherry-picking commit XXXXXXX.
      (all conflicts fixed: run "git cherry-pick --continue")
      (use "git cherry-pick --skip" to skip this patch)
      (use "git cherry-pick --abort" to cancel the cherry-pick operation)

   nothing to commit, working tree clean
   The previous cherry-pick is now empty, possibly due to conflict resolution.
   If you wish to commit it anyway, use:

      git commit --allow-empty

   Otherwise, please use 'git cherry-pick --skip'
   ```

   If the files are in the state you want them to be, and you don't need a commit in your history, use the recommended skip option:

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick --skip
   ```

   If you want to have a record in your history showing that you attempted to apply this specific commit, use the command Git suggests:

   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty
   ```

7. [Push your changes](#push-changes-to-the-remote-repository) to the remote repository.
8. [Create a new PR](#create-a-pr). Ensure you change the base branch to the appropriate version branch before clicking the 'Create pull request' button.

## Getting started

We built this project with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and host it on the [Read the Docs platform](https://readthedocs.org).

The `docs/` directory contains the content, written in [reStructuredText (RST)](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html).

---

There are three ways to work on changes for the Mautic User Documentation:

1. Directly on GitHub
2. With [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) on your browser
3. With a code editor, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), on your local machine — **recommended**

### 1. On GitHub

Making changes directly on GitHub is suitable for minor changes, such as fixing a typo. For bigger and more complex changes, please use GitHub Codespaces or work locally.

To work directly on GitHub, follow the steps below:

1. Click the 'Edit on GitHub' button on the top right of the page where you noticed the mistake. It takes you to the correct resource on GitHub.

   ![Screenshot of community handbook with a red box highlighting the Edit on GitHub button](../assets/images/edit_on_github.png)

2. Click the edit button — which resembles a pencil — and make the necessary changes.

   ![Screenshot of community handbook with a red box highlighting the Edit on GitHub button](../assets/images/edit_button_github.png)

3. Follow the instructions to commit the changes.
4. Select to commit to a new branch. Call the branch something relative to what you are updating.
5. [Create a PR](#create-a-pr). Read the "[Submitting a PR](#submitting-a-pr)" section about all info that you need to include in your PR.

### 2. GitHub Codespaces

Using GitHub Codespaces lets you quickly spin up the project in the cloud. For a smooth process, use the Chrome or Firefox browser to work with Codespaces.

<!-- REMOVE DETAILS AND SUMMARY TAGS -->

#### Tips to Maximize Free Tier of Codespaces

To maximize your free tier of Codespaces, you can set the default idle timeout. To do so:

1. Click your avatar on the top right.
2. Click 'Settings'.
3. At the left bar, under 'Code, planning, and automation', click 'Codespaces'.
4. Find 'Default idle timeout'.
5. Set the idle time, and click 'Save'.

You can also shut down your codespace whenever you've finished working by following these steps:

1. Close your codespace.
2. Go to [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces).
3. Scroll down and you should see a list of your Codespaces.
4. Click the three dots icon at the codespace that you'd like to shut down.
5. Click 'Stop codespace'.

---

#### Setting up a codespace

1. [Fork](#forking-the-repository) this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
3. Click the branch dropdown menu on the top left and select the branch you need to base your changes on. For example, if you need to update documentation for Mautic version 5, switch to `5.x`, and so on.

   ![Highlight branch dropdown menu on GitHub](../assets/images/switch_branch_github.png)

4. Click the green 'Code' button and select the 'Codespaces' tab.
5. Click the green 'Create codespace on BRANCH-NAME' or '+' button to create a new codespace. Codespace automatically sets up the project and opens Visual Studio Code.

   ![Highlight Codespaces tab, plus icon, and Create codepace on main at GitHub](../assets/images/codespaces_tab_github.png)

6. Wait until the codespace finishes building. Once it's finished, the build prompt closes, the README preview opens — you can close this preview, and the `postCreateCommand` runs. Please wait until it finishes doing its job.

   ![Screenshot of postCreateCommand running in terminal](../assets/images/postcreatecommand_on_terminal.png)
7. [Create a new branch](#create-a-new-branch) to work on your changes.

<!-- CHANGE TO ADMONITION. IT FEELS DESTRACTING. -->

> [!NOTE]
> Once you create a new branch, it automatically switches to your new branch. If you haven't seen the branch changes in your terminal, run `git status`, and you should see your branch name.

8. Go to the `docs/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

9. Find the folder and file that you need to work on.
10. Work on your changes and use the [live preview](#live-preview-on-codespace) to view and test your changes in real-time.
11. Ensure that the changes you made follow Mautic's style guide by running the Vale lint. Please read the "[Working with Vale](#working-with-vale)" section to use Vale.

#### Live preview on codespace

1. Ensure that you're in the `docs/` directory.
2. Run `make html`. It generates the `build` folder.

   <!-- CHANGE TO ADMONITION. THIS TIP IS PART OF POINT 2. THE INDENTATION WORKS, BUT THE ADMONITION FORMAT BREAKS. -->

   > [!TIP]
   >
   > If you get `make: *** No rule to make target 'html'. Stop.` error message after running the `make html` command, you should check if you're in the correct directory. You must be in the `docs/` directory to run this command.

4. Click the preview button — resembles a book and a magnifying glass — at the top to trigger Esbonio, a tool used for live preview. A tab opens, but the preview won't work. You can safely close this tab.

    ![Highlight preview button on the top bar of VS Code on codespace](../assets/images/preview_button_vscode_codespace.png)

5. At the bottom panel, click the 'Ports' tab.
6. Click the globe icon to open the live preview in your browser. Now you can see the project in real-time on localhost.

   ![Highlight port tab and globe icon to open preview in browser at VS Code on codespace](../assets/images/port_and_open_browser_vscode_codespace.png)

> [!TIP]
>
> - Always refresh the page to view the new changes you have applied.
> - All commands only work within the `docs/`directory. If you're unable to run a command, verify that you're in the correct directory.
> - Read the "[Troubleshooting live preview](#troubleshooting-live-preview)" section if you encounter any issues with the live preview in the codespace.

---

<!-- REMOVE DETAILS AND SUMMARY TAGS -->

**Troubleshooting live preview**

**Troubleshooting #1**

If you can't see your changes in the live preview, try **refreshing the page**.

**Troubleshooting #2**

If refreshing doesn't work, try to:

1. Delete the `build` folder in the root.
2. Delete the `build` folder in the `docs` directory.
3. Refresh your codespace browser.
4. Ensure that you're in the `docs/` directory.
5. Follow the steps in the [Live Preview on Codespace](#live-preview-on-codespace) section.

**Troubleshooting #3**

If the above steps fail:

1. Close VS Code and the live preview browsers.
2. Go to [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces).
3. At the bottom, you should see a list of your codespaces.
4. Click the three dots icon on the right of your project's codespace.
5. Click 'Stop codespace'.
6. Re-open the codespace by clicking its name.
7. Follow the steps in the [Live Preview on Codespace](#live-preview-on-codespace) section.

If you're ready to push your changes to the remote repository and create a PR, please read the "[Push changes to the remote repository](#push-changes-to-the-remote-repository)" and "[Create a PR](#create-a-pr)" sections.

### 3. Local development

#### Prerequisite

To work locally, you first need to install these on your machine:

1. **VS Code (recommended) or your preferred IDE**

   If you haven't, [download and install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) on your computer.

2. **DDEV**

   Mautic uses [DDEV](https://ddev.com) to simplify local development and testing of documentation updates. Go to the [Get Started](https://ddev.com/get-started/) page on their website for instructions to install DDEV on your local machine.

   **For Windows users**: you can install and run DDEV on [traditional Windows](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#system-requirements-traditional-windows). However, using [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) provides faster, better performance. If you're new to WSL, follow the instructions on the [DDEV blog](https://ddev.com/blog/watch-new-windows-installer/) to install and set up WSL and DDEV.

3. **Vale**

   Mautic uses [Vale](https://vale.sh/) to maintain style guide consistency across the docs. Go to the "[Install](https://vale.sh/docs/install)" page on the official docs to install Vale on your computer.

4. **GitHub CLI (Optional)**

   You can [download and install GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) on your computer if you'd like. It could save you time to work on your GitHub workflow with GitHub CLI, particularly if you want to assist with code reviews.

#### Setting up local environment

1. [Fork](#forking-the-repository) this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
3. [Clone](#clone-the-repository) your forked repository.
4. Navigate into the project directory by running:

   ```bash
   cd developer-documentation-new
   ```

   Replace `developer-documentation-new` with the name of the project you provided. For example, `dev-docs-5`, `dev-docs-7`, etc.

5. [Create a new branch](#create-a-new-branch) to work on your changes.
6. Start the DDEV environment with this command:

   ```bash
   ddev start
   ```

7. Go to the `docs/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

8. Find the folder and file that you want to work on.
9. Make changes and ensure that the changes you made follow Mautic's style guide by running the Vale lint. Please read the "[Working with Vale](#working-with-vale)" section to use Vale. Use the live preview to ensure everything works as intended in real time.
10. Build the project by running:

    ```bash
    ddev build-docs
    ```

11. Run the below command to view your changes live on your browser:

    ```bash
    ddev launch
    ```

   DDEV uses the folder name as the project name. This command automatically opens your browser and navigates to `https://FOLDER-NAME.ddev.site/`.

> [!TIP]
>
> - Every time you make changes, run `ddev build-docs` and refresh the page in your browser to see the changes.
> - If you don't see the configuration take effect, run `ddev restart` to restart the project.

If you're ready to push your changes to the remote repository and create a PR, please read the "[Push changes to the remote repository](#push-changes-to-the-remote-repository)" and "[Create a PR](#create-a-pr)" sections.

## Working with links

In this section, you can find the commands you need to work with links. Ensure you're in the `docs/` directory to run these commands.

### Create a new link

When you need to add a link, you can do so by running the command below — depending on where you work on your changes — in the terminal.

If you work with Codespaces:

```bash
make link
```

If you work locally with DDEV:

```bash
ddev exec make link
```

Then input the answer to all prompts:

- **Enter a Unique Link Name:** The name of the link.
- **Enter the link text the user sees:** The link that appears on the website.
- **Enter the URL:** The link URL.
- **Enter the .py file name (use_lower_case_and_underscore of link name):** The name of the file.

> [!TIP]
> Ensure that all entries are clear and general so that anyone working on this project can easily search for and reuse them.

Here's an example:

```bash
Enter a Unique Link Name: Developer Documentation
Enter the link text the user sees: Developer Documentation
Enter the URL: https://devdocs.mautic.org/
Enter the .py file name (use_lower_case_and_underscore of link name): mautic_developer_docs
```

### Check broken links

To prevent build failures, ensure there are no broken links. You can check the links by following the instructions below, depending on where you work on your changes, in the terminal.

If you work with Codespaces:

```bash
make checklinks
```

If you work locally with DDEV:

```bash
ddev exec make checklinks
```

You should see a list of links. Find the broken link and fix it. Here's an example of a broken link:

![Example of a broken link with error message: (contributing/contributing_docs_rst: line  198) broken    https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html#add-link-make-command - 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references.html](../assets/images/broken_link_example.png)

## Working with Vale

Your changes must follow Mautic's style guide. To ensure that the changes are consistent with the style guide, in your terminal:

1. Ensure that you're in the `docs/` directory.

   If you're not, and assuming you're in the project's root, you can run this command:

   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

2. Run Vale:

   ```bash
   vale folder_name/file_name.rst
   ```

3. Look at the errors, warnings, and suggestions.
4. Address all of them and rerun Vale to ensure they pass the checks.
5. If you're sure that the style is good but Vale still gives suggestions, you can wrap the sentence in `.. vale off` and `.. vale on` statements. Here's an example:

   ```rst
   .. vale off

   Regarding assets like JavaScript and CSS, the source files are loaded instead of concatenated, minified files. This way, the changes in those files will be directly visible when refreshed. If you want to see the change in the production environment, run this command:

   .. vale on
   ```

   If the suggestion targets a specific point in a list, you first need to ensure that the entire list adheres to the style guide. Then, wrap the whole list in the `.. vale off` and `.. vale on` statements as example below:

   ```rst
   .. vale off

   * All PRs are made against the ``c.x`` branch in the first instance, for instance, ``5.x``.
   * If the PR should be merged in an earlier release than the next major release of Mautic, duplicate the PR against the relevant ``a.b`` branch for bug fixes - for example, ``5.0`` - or ``a.x`` branch for features and enhancements - for example, ``5.x``.
   * Backwards compatibility breaking changes can only be released in a major version, so they should only ever be made against the ``c.x`` branch, such as, ``5.x``.

   .. vale on
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Ensure that you wrap the sentences that you'd like Vale to skip with both `.. vale off` and `.. vale on` statements, in order. Failing to do so results in Vale lint skipping the rest of the contents.
> - Don't add statements to skip lint, unless necessary. If you're uncertain, it's best not to wrap them in the statements and let the team review and provide suggestions.

## Adding a code sample

Code samples get downloaded from GitHub to ensure that they're always up to date. If you want to add a new code sample, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.py` file in the `docs/code_samples/` folder. For example: `helloworld_entity_world.py`.

2. Copy and paste the template below:

   ```python
   from . import _main_code_sample

   # Output file name must be unique!
   output_file_name = "OUTPUT_FILE_NAME.php"
   # Ensure that the URL always starts with https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...
   url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mautic/REPOSITORY-NAME/BRANCH-NAME/FOLDER-NAME/FILE_NAME.php" 

   _main_code_sample.code_samples.update({output_file_name: (url)})
   ```

3. Change `OUTPUT_FILE_NAME.php` to a unique file name using two or more words separated by an underscore. For example: `entity_world.php`.

4. Change `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mautic/REPOSITORY_NAME/BRANCH-NAME/FOLDER-NAME/FILE_NAME.php` to the URL of the code sample file on GitHub. 

<!-- CHANGE TO ADMONITION. IT BREAKS THE INDENTATION AND POTENTIALLY MAKES FOLKS UNAWARE OF THE 5TH POINT-->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
>  URLs to the code sample should always start with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...` to ensure that Sphinx can download the file correctly. You also need to remove `/blob` from the original URL.

   For instance, the code example that you want to provide is available in the `plugin-helloworld` repository with this URL:
   
   ```text
   https://github.com/mautic/plugin-helloworld/blob/mautic-4/Entity/World.php
   ```
   
   Then, the code sample URL should be:
   
   ```text
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mautic/plugin-helloworld/mautic-4/Entity/World.php
   ```

   Here's the complete example:

   ```python
   from . import _main_code_sample

   output_file_name = "helloworld_entity_world.py"
   url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mautic/plugin-helloworld/mautic-4/Entity/World.php"

   _main_code_sample.code_samples.update({output_file_name: (url)})
   ```

5. In the documentation RST file where you need to add the code sample, add a `literalinclude` block to include the code:

   ```python
   .. literalinclude:: ../code_samples_downloaded/OUTPUT_FILE_NAME.php
       :language: php
   ```

   Here's an example:

   ```python
   .. literalinclude:: ../code_samples_downloaded/entity_world.php
       :language: php
   ```

<!-- CHANGE TO ADMONITION. THIS NOTE IS FOR POINT 5. BUT IT NOW SEEMS AS A NOTE FOR THE WHOLE SECTION. -->

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you change the URL to a file, delete the cached file from `docs/code_samples/__pycache__` and run `ddev build-docs`. Sphinx automatically re-downloads it.
